# Thesis: Emotion Recognition in English and Greek Speech: Deep CNN with 2D Spectral Features and Transfer Learning
## Electrical & Computer Engineering - MEng.
This work is based on the thesis "Speech Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning" and aims to build a robust system for recognizing speech emotions through the utilization of supervised labeled data and advanced deep-learning techniques with an image classification approach. The core objective is to construct a model that can precisely distinguish between 7 emotional states for English speakers. The investigation extends to the analysis of the influence of three specific spectral features, extracted from the audio samples. These features are treated as images, each displayed in four different output sizes resulting from a quadratic transformation achieved through bilinear image interpolation. We also emphasize the evaluation of three custom abstract Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Furthermore , we study the impact of the optimized pre-trained English Speech Emotion Recognition model when applied to speech samples from Greek speakers. A limited dataset of Greek speech is employed to train, validate, and test the model's performance, while we assess the knowledge of the model's pre-trained layers.
